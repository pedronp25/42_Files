1. Basic Questions

    1.1. What is a virtual machine (VM) and how does it work?
         - A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software that emulates a physical computer.
		 - There are two types of VM's:
			• System VM --> run a full OS on top of another
			• Process VM --> run just one program in a special environment

    1.2. What are the basic differences between 'Rocky' and 'Debian'?
		- Rocky Linux:
			• Copy of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) --> (a stable but paid OS)
			• Made for businesses and servers; very stable

		- Debian:
			• Built independently (not a copy of anything)
			• Made for general use and desktop usage --> User friendly

	1.3. What's the purpose of a VM?
	    - Isolate environments (e.g., development, testing)
	    - Run multiple OSes on one machine 
				(ex.: using Linux in a Windows PC without installing the OS)
	
	1.4. What's the difference between "aptitude" and "apt"? And what is each of them?
	    - apt:
	        • Simplified CLI tool for managing DEB packages
	        • Common for installing/updating packages
	    - aptitude:
	        • Advanced package manager with better dependency resolution
					(If there's a certain asset needed when installing something,
						aptitude as a better chance to automatically install it)
	        • Includes a text-based user interface (TUI)

	1.5. What's "AppArmor"?
	    - A Linux security module that applies restrictions to programs.
	    - Helps contain software vulnerabilities and reduce risk.

	1.6. What's "LVM"?
	    - LVM = Logical Volume Manager
	    - Manages disk space using flexible "logical volumes" instead of fixed partitions.
	    - Allows resizing, extending, and combining volumes easily.
	    - Useful for dynamic or growing storage needs.

2. Evaluation Commands

	2.01 Check for no graphical interface -> "ls /usr/bin/*session"
											(it should appear "/usr/bin/dbus-run-session")

	2.02 Check that UFW is active -> "sudo ufw status" or "sudo service ufw status"

	2.03 Check that SSH is active -> "sudo service ssh status"

	2.04 Check that the OS is Debian -> "uname --kernel-version"

	2.05 Check that my user is within 'sudo' and 'user42' groups -> "getent group sudo user42"

	2.06 Create new user and check that it follows the password policy -> "sudo adduser name_user"

	2.07 Create new group named "evaluating" -> "sudo addgroup evaluating"

	2.08 Add new user to new group -> "sudo adduser name_user evaluating"

	2.09 Check hostname -> "hostname"

	2.10 Change hostname:
		2.10.1 Enter these files and change "pedromig42" with the new hostname using:
			   "sudo vim /etc/hostname" and "sudo vim /etc/hosts"
		2.10.2 Reboot the VA -> "sudo reboot"
		2.10.3 Check hostname -> "hostname"

	2.11 Check partitions -> "lsblk"

	2.12 Check that 'sudo' is installed -> "which sudo"

	2.13 Add new user to the 'sudo' group -> "sudo adduser name_user sudo"

	2.14 Check the 'sudo' group -> "getent group sudo"

	2.15 Check the rules imposed for 'sudo' by the subject -> "vim /etc/sudoers.d/sudo_config"

	2.16 Check 'sudo' logs -> "vim /var/log/sudo/sudo_config"

	2.17 Check that 'UFW' is installed -> "dpkg -s ufw"

	2.18 List active rules in 'UFW' -> "sudo ufw status numbered"

	2.19 Create new rule for port 8080 -> "sudo ufw allow 8080" (and repeat 2.18)

	2.20 Delete new rule -> "sudo ufw delete num_rule"

	2.21 Check that 'SSH' service is installed -> "which ssh"

	2.22 Check 'SSH' usage:
		 2.22.1 "ssh root@pedromig42 -p 4242" shouldn't work because there's no permission
		 2.22.2 "ssh new_user@pedromig42 -p 4242" should work

	2.23 Check and modify script runtime -> "sudo crontab -e"

3. Extra Important Topics

    3.1. What's the value and operation of 'sudo'? What are some examples?
	    - 'sudo' = "Superuser do"
	    - Lets regular users run commands as root (admin)
	    - Logs commands and improves system security
	    - Examples:
	        sudo apt update
	        sudo systemctl restart ssh
	        sudo useradd pedro

	3.2. What's 'UFW' and what's its value?
	    - UFW = Uncomplicated Firewall
	    - A user-friendly way to configure the system firewall
	    - Value:
	         • Controls incoming/outgoing network traffic
	         • Easy syntax

	3.3. What's 'SSH' and what's its value?
	    - SSH = Secure Shell
	    - A protocol for securely accessing remote systems
	    - Encrypts data (unlike Telnet)
	    - Value:
	         • Used for remote administration and file transfer

	3.4. What's 'cron'?
	    - 'cron' is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like systems
	    - Automates tasks like backups, updates, and monitoring
	    - Uses crontab to define jobs
